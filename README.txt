My program contains code to generate various kinds of curves in space. My program generates these curves by writing x, y, and z values to a file. The curves created are a subdivision curve and a Catmull-Rom curve. To compile my program simply type "make". This will create two executables called "subd" and "catrom". Then, to run my program, simply type "./subd" and "./catrom". This will cause the curves to be written to the files, "subd.txt" and "catrom.txt". The curves are based on points provided.
